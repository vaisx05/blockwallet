Great! Now that you have the transaction hash 0xb6997aad1f298d3d5d62ab70f71a9c6559fea2594097212058b5c453b57ad784, you can check its status on your Ganache CLI using the following steps.

Step 1: Check Transaction Receipt in Ganache CLI
Run the following curl command to get the transaction receipt and check if it was successful:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt","params":["0xcafe441b9b7df148aa9eec14accdcfd11821612e65a2e0a661093c93f490849d"],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
Step 2: Response Example
The response will look like this (the fields might vary):

json
Copy code
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "transactionHash": "0xb6997aad1f298d3d5d62ab70f71a9c6559fea2594097212058b5c453b57ad784",
    "transactionIndex": "0x0",
    "blockHash": "0xabc1234abcd5678efghijklmnopq1234567890",
    "blockNumber": "0x1",  // Shows the block number
    "from": "0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d",
    "to": "0xFFcf8FDEE72ac11b5c542428B35EEF5769C409f0",
    "gasUsed": "0x10",  // Shows the gas used in the transaction
    "logs": [],
    "status": "0x1"  // If 0x1, the transaction was successful
  }
}
Step 3: Interpreting the Response
transactionHash: This will match the hash you provided (0xb6997aad1f298d3d5d62ab70f71a9c6559fea2594097212058b5c453b57ad784).
blockNumber: If this is set (e.g., 0x1), it means the transaction has been mined.
status: "0x1" means the transaction was successful. If itâ€™s "0x0", the transaction failed.
gasUsed: This is the amount of gas consumed for the transaction.
Step 4: Check Sender and Recipient Balances
After confirming the transaction was successful, you can check the balances of the sender and recipient to ensure the amount was transferred.

For example, to check the sender's balance:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d", "latest"],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
For the recipient's balance:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xFFcf8FDEE72ac11b5c542428B35EEF5769C409f0", "latest"],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
Conclusion
If the status is "0x1", the transaction was successful, and you can check the balances of the sender and recipient to ensure the transaction was processed.
